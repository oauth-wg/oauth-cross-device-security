In reality, however, they're just completing the second leg of a flow initiated by some attacker's script. \r\n\r\nWhile you mention \"emulating an enterprise application\", I don't think that provides the clearest example of why this is particularly scary. I think you could go a bit further and emphasize that everything the user sees in this sort of attack is: a) trusted UX and b) indicates that they're signing into a trusted application. ",

      "body": "We came across Examples A5 and A7, which refer to the \"User-Transferred Authorization Data Pattern\" described in Section 2.3. However, we are not sure whether these examples are in line with the description of the flow. In particular, our main concern is related to the identification of the Initiating Device and Authorization Device, as these entities cannot be uniquely assigned to any of the two devices involved (personal computer and mobile device).\r\n\r\nConsidering Example A5, the employee \u201cis logged-in on the personal computer where they initiate the process\u201d, so we would expect the personal computer to be the Initiating Device. However, this cannot be true as:\r\n- the QR code should be displayed on the personal computer, not on the mobile device;\r\n- the final authorization is granted to the personal computer (which is, indeed, already connected to the network) instead of the mobile device.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the personal computer should be considered as the Authorization Device, as it is already connected to the network, thus it is responsible for displaying the QR code and granting the mobile device access to the network it is connected to. However, this cannot be true as the process should be started on the personal computer, not on the mobile device.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it seems that the personal computer plays both roles sometimes during the process: it initiates the process (as an Initiating Device) and displays the QR code (as an Authorizing Device), while the mobile device cannot be really identified in the flow.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if QR codes can be used as authorization data in this flow (step D), this should be made explicit in the description of the flow (as already done in Section 2.1 when referring to the \"User-Transferred Session Data Pattern\", at step C).\r\n\r\nCC @giadas",

In addition, although it is a cross-device flow, it is different in that it is more about a session transfer/authorization transfer. Options to consider:\r\n\r\n1. These are the equivalent to regular phishing and social engineering attacks and are out of scope for this spec (e.g. the attacks does not result in the user authenticating, but rather in the artefact being moved)\r\n2. We can broaden the definition of cross device flows to include these session transfer scenarios and create a new flow, even though this is not strictly a cross-device consent attack (i.e. introduce a new cross-device attack that is not about consent, but more generally about transferring QR codes and other artefacts). \r\n\r\n@danielfett what kind of attacks are you seeing in the decentralised identity space, and should these be covered here as well?",

In general, the identifying information could be any attribute retrievable by the Authorizing Device during the authorization process. This contributes to reducing the attack surface by restricting non-targeted attacks.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the Italian context, we use the serial number of the user's eID card as identifying information; after interacting with the eID card, the Authorizing Device is able to verify that the value contained in the QR code (i.e., that inserted by the user) matches the real attribute extracted from the eID card.\r\n \r\n*Limitations: The identifying information could be captured through phishing and used to launch an attack; the additional step could reduce the usability level of the protocol.*\r\n\r\nEffect on attacks (Table 1): `disrupt`.",

Potentially it even means that if you're having trouble deciding between different possible ways of doing things the availability of the API might push you towards using OID4VP to get cross device security.\r\n\r\nThe main downside is that it's still under development so isn't technically stable nor widely available yet, but Apple & Google have demoed it working cross device between different OSes.",

I had a read of the latest draft with this in mind, I think it might be worthy of mentions:\r\n\r\n1.  in Section 5 when introducing verifiable presentations standard that as well as the standard QR based flow there is a secure cross device flow using the browser API.\r\n2. in 6.1.1 around \"BLE presents another alternative for establishing proximity, but may present user experience challenges when setting up\" tacking on something like \"unless mediated by the OS\" or something like that as although the browser API cross based flow does use BLE it doesn't require the user to navigate the traditional device pairing flow that I think is being referred to here (to oversimplify, it combines QR codes with BLE and CTAP in a very similar to webauthn as is already described in section 6.2.3.1).\r\n3. In 6.2, a new subsection for OID4VP over browser API might be warranted.\r\n",

They then use social engineering techniques to change the context in which authorization is requested to trick end-users to scan the QR code or enter it on their Authorization Device (e.g., mobile phone). Once the end-user performs the authorization on the mobile device, the attacker who initiated the authentication or authorization request obtains access to the users resources.

BLE presents another alternative for establishing proximity, but may present user experience challenges when setting up. UWB standards such as IEEE  802.15.4 and the IEEE 802.15.4z-2020 Amendment 1 enable secure ranging between devices and allow devices to establish proximity releative to each other [@IEEE802154].\r\n```",

In these flows, the user is already authenticated and they request authorization data to transfer a session or obtain some other privilege such as joining a device to a network. The authorization data may be represented as a QR code or authorization code.

Although a software proof-of-posession key is better than no proof-of-posession key, an attacker may still exfiltrate the software key. Hardware keys are harder to exfiltrate, but come with additional implementation complexity. An attacker that controls the Initiating Device may still be able to excercise the key, even if it is in hardware. Consequently the main protection derived from sender-constrained tokens is preventing tokens from being moved from the Initiating Device to another device, thereby making it harder sell stolen tokens and profit from the attack.\r\n```",

One-time use codes may also have an impact on the user experience. For example, a user may enter a code, but their session may be interrupted before the access request is completed. If the code is a one-time use code, they would need to restart the session and obtain a new code since they won't be allowed to enter the same code a second time. To avoid this, implementers MAY allow the same code to be presented a small number of times.\r\n```",

The service provider MAY educate users on the risks of cross-device consent phishing and provide out-of-band reinforcement to the user on the context and conditions under which an authorization grant may be requested. For example, if the service provider does not send e-mails with QR codes requesting users to grant authorization, this may be reinforced in marketing messages and anti-fraud awareness campaigns. The service provider MAY also choose to reinforce these user education messages through in-app experiences.\r\n```",

The analysis was performed using the specification language ASLan++ and the model checker SATMC. According to the results of the analysis, they identified and defined the category of *implicit attacks*, which manage to deceive users into approving a malicious authentication attempt through social engineering techniques, thus not compromising all the authentication factors involved; these attacks are aligned with the definition of Cross-Device Consent Phishing (CDCP) attacks.

The Authorization Device requests a session transfer code that may be rendered as a QR code on the Authorization Device. When the user scans the QR code or enters it on the Consumption Device where they would like the session to continue, the Consumption Device presents it to the Authorization Server. The Authorization Server then transfers the session to the Consumption Device. This may include transferring authentication and authorization state to optimise the user experience. This type of flow is used for adding new devices to networks, bootstrapping new applications or provisioning new credentials. The Pre-Authorized Code Flow in ([@OpenID.VCI])) is an example of using this pattern to provision a new credential. The figure below shows an example of this flow.\r\n```",
